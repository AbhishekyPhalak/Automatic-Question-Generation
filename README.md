# Automatic Question Generation System

A server-side application that generates multiple types of questions, such as MCQs, Fill in the Blanks, Wh-questions, and crosswords, based on the input text. The system uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for question generation. It leverages Flask for the backend and machine learning models for question generation and text summarization.

### Features

- **MCQ Generation**: Generates multiple-choice questions by analyzing the text.
- **Fill in the Blanks**: Identifies key words in the text and replaces them with blanks for user input.
- **Wh-Question Generation**: Automatically generates questions using "Who," "What," "Where," etc.
- **Crossword Generation**: Converts important answers in the text into crossword-style puzzles.
- **Text Summarization**: Summarizes long texts into short versions.
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Identifies named entities (like persons or locations) to generate specific questions.

## Question Generation

### MCQ Generation
For MCQ generation, pivotal answers are identified using POS and NER tagging. Wrong options are generated by identifying contextually similar words via GloVe word embeddings and cosine similarity.

### Fill in the Blanks
This question type is generated by identifying important answers from the text and replacing them with blanks. The system uses a Na√Øve Bayes model trained on the SQuAD v1 dataset to predict these key answers.

### Crossword Generation
Crossword puzzles are created using the answers from the Fill in the Blanks section. Words are placed randomly in a 15x15 grid, with clues generated using NLP techniques. Randomized placement ensures variety in the puzzles.

### Wh-Question Generation
Wh-questions are created by analyzing sentence structure and identifying relevant named entities. The system uses rule-based approaches based on POS and NER tagging:

- **NER-Based Algorithm**: Replaces identified entities with corresponding Wh-words (e.g., "Where" for locations).
- **Discourse Marker-Based Algorithm**: Uses discourse markers like "because" to reframe sentences into Wh-questions.
- **Non-Discourse Marker-Based Algorithm**: Generates yes/no questions by identifying auxiliary verbs in declarative sentences.

### Summary Generation
The summary generation is accomplished using a transformer model (T5), which condenses the text into a brief version, making it easier to extract relevant information for question generation.
